/**
 *The bfs function takes in two parameters: the graph represented as an array, and the starting node.
 * The graph is represented as an associative array, where the keys are the nodes and the values are arrays of
 * their neighbors.

To use this implementation, you can define your graph as an associative array and call the bfs function with
 * the starting node:
