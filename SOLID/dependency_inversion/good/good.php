/**
 * In this revised code, we have introduced the DatabaseInterface interface, which Database class implements.
 * The UserService class now depends on the DatabaseInterface interface instead of the Database class directly.
 * This allows us to change the implementation of the Database class without affecting the UserService class,
 * as long as the new implementation still implements the DatabaseInterface interface.

By following the Dependency Inversion principle, our code becomes more flexible and easier to maintain,
 * as changes in the low-level modules will not affect the high-level modules. It also makes our code more testable,
 * as we can easily create mock implementations of the DatabaseInterface interface for testing purposes.
